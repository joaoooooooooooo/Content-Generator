// can crash the board stage when the scene has no active track/template (see
// BoardStage.tsx), so the route stays closed until that is fixed. Dropping the
// export costs a feature too: BoardExportBar is the only caller of
// downloadSceneZip, and DesktopEditor only mounts it while the board section is
// active — deliberate, not an oversight, since the export needs a home outside
// Boards before it can come back (lib/exportScene.ts packs
// boardPose/boardCompose and emits a board).
