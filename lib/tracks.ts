// ============================================================
//  MOTION TRACKS — stacked motion layers on one shared timeline
//
//  A track is a self-contained mini-clip: its own template, its own control
//  values, its own easing curve, its own slice of the asset list, and its own
//  window on the scene timeline. The renderer draws one Pixi container per
//  track, in array order, so tracks composite over each other.
//
//  The scene clock stays single (principle 1: ONE clock for preview AND
//  export). Tracks never keep their own time — `resolveTrackTime` maps the
//  scene frame to a track-local frame, purely, every frame.
//
//  LOOP GUARANTEE. Templates quantize their speed with `loopCycles()` against
//  `ctx.totalFrames`, which is what makes frame 0 ≡ frame totalFrames. A track
//  therefore receives its WINDOW length as `totalFrames`, not the clip length:
//  each track loops seamlessly inside its own window. A track spanning the full
//  clip at timeScale 1 / offset 0 gets localFrame === frame and
//  localTotal === totalFrames, so it is bit-identical to the single-template
//  behaviour that predates tracks.
