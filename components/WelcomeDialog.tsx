            This is an open-source adaptation of several motion libraries —
            CodePen demos, React Bits, React Motion, JS motion work and others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use it freely, including at work and in production. The one thing the
            licence holds back is <b>offering Moonvine Studio to other people as a
            hosted service</b> — that stays with the maintainers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a <b>beta</b>: since it&apos;s still being tested, some things
            might break or behave unexpectedly.
